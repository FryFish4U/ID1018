// NumberSequence

/****************************************************************

NumberSequence represents a sequence of real numbers.

It is possible to obtain the length of the sequence, and to
determine upper and lower bound for the sequence.
The number at a specified position can be determined, as well
as the position for a specified number.
It is possible to examine if the sequence is increasing, or
decreasing, and to examine presence of the specified number.
A number can be added to the end of the sequence and
inserted at a specified position. The number at a specified
position can be removed.
The numbers in the sequence can be obtained in an array.
